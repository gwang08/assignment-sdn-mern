## User Management Workflows

### User Creation Flow

### Student-Parent Relationship Workflow

## Access Control and Authentication

### Authentication Flow

    B -->|If Valid| C[JWT Token]
    C -->|Used For| D[Protected Endpoints]
    B -->|If Invalid| E[Error Response]
```

### Unified User Model

The system uses a unified User model for all user types. Each user has a `role` field that determines their permissions and access level:

- `admin`: Administrators with full system access
- `medicalStaff`: Medical staff members (with additional `staff_role` field)
- `parent`: Parents who can link to students
- `student`: Students in the system

### Authorization Levels

1. **Admin**

   - Full system access
   - Can create all user types
   - Can manage system settings
   - Can create/manage students
   - Can manage student-parent relationships
   - Can create staff accounts

2. **Medical Staff**

   - Can create/manage medical events
   - Can create/manage health campaigns
   - Can view student health records

3. **Parents**

   - Can view their linked students' information
   - Can request student links
   - Can respond to campaign consents

4. **Students**
   - Can view their own health records
   - Limited system access

## Error Handling

All API endpoints follow a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "affected_field",
      "message": "Specific error message"
    }
  ]
}
```

Common HTTP Status Codes:

- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Server Error

## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**

   - Always include the JWT token in the x-auth-token header
   - Tokens expire after 24 hours
   - Keep tokens secure and never share them

2. **Data Validation**

   - Always validate required fields
   - Use proper data types as specified in the API
   - Follow the specified formats for dates, emails, etc.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Always check response status codes
   - Handle errors gracefully in your application
   - Log errors for debugging purposes
